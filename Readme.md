# üöÄ C++ ‚Äì General Purpose Programming Language

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is known for supporting multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented, procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.

## üåü Key Features of C++:

	1.	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
	‚Ä¢	C++ supports OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. This allows developers to create reusable and modular code through the use of classes and objects.
	2.	Templates:
	‚Ä¢	C++ provides templates to allow for generic programming. This feature enables developers to write reusable functions and classes that can operate with any data type, promoting code flexibility.
	3.	Standard Template Library (STL):
	‚Ä¢	The STL offers a rich set of templates for containers (like vectors, lists, and maps), algorithms, and iterators, making it easier to manage data and write efficient programs.
	4.	Low-Level System Programming:
	‚Ä¢	One of C++‚Äôs strongest points is its ability to handle low-level memory manipulation using pointers and manual memory management. This makes it suitable for system-level programming, such as building operating systems and device drivers.
	5.	Exception Handling:
	‚Ä¢	C++ offers robust exception handling mechanisms, which help write more reliable code by managing errors and unexpected situations gracefully.

## üîß Common Use Cases

C++ is widely used across various industries for both system-level programming and high-level application development:

	‚Ä¢	Operating Systems: Components of popular operating systems like Windows and macOS are written in C++.
	‚Ä¢	Game Development: Many game engines like Unreal Engine are built using C++ because of its performance and low-level access.
	‚Ä¢	Desktop Applications: Applications requiring high performance, such as Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, and AutoCAD, rely on C++.
	‚Ä¢	Embedded Systems: C++ is often used in embedded systems programming, providing control over hardware in environments with limited resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key C++ Components

Here are some essential components that make C++ a powerful language:

1. Classes and Objects
   	‚Ä¢	C++ supports object-oriented programming where classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. These classes can encapsulate data and behavior, providing more structure and modularity to programs.

 
   class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int year;

    void start() {
        cout << "Car started." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.year = 2020;
    myCar.start();
}

2. Templates

	‚Ä¢	Function templates and class templates in C++ allow for generic programming. You can write a single function or class to handle different types of data.

	‚Ä¢	C++ supports object-oriented programming where classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. These classes can encapsulate data and behavior, providing more structure and modularity to programs.

template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << add(10, 20) << endl;  // Adds integers
    cout << add(10.5, 20.5) << endl;  // Adds floats
}

3. Standard Template Library (STL)

	‚Ä¢	The STL provides a wide range of data structures (like vector, list, map) and algorithms (like sort, find, reverse).

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6};
    std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());

    for(int num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
